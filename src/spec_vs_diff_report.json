  "summary": "REQ-8 and REQ-9 appear implemented in ValentineActions (button labels exactly “Yes”/“No”, and hover/tap on “No” triggers shrink/grow with smooth transition while still delegating to the existing no-interaction counter via onNoInteraction). REQ-10 is only partially met: heading and final line match, but the body text does not demonstrate the required exact wording preservation (notably the curly apostrophe in “I’m”).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Success screen body text must exactly match the user-provided wording for Naina, preserving punctuation/capitalization/emojis/line breaks, including the curly apostrophe in “I’m”, and include the closing line “I love you so much naina”.",
      "reason": "The success body uses a straight apostrophe (\"I'm\") rather than the required curly apostrophe (“I’m”), and the diff does not show evidence that the body text exactly matches the user-provided paragraph (e.g., required exact punctuation like a closing quote/period).",
